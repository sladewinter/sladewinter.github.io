subtitle: Pursuing Master’s in Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Science
---

My primary interest is Machine Learning and I am looking forward to learn a bit more every day:

- I completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College back in 2018.
- After that I worked for 2 years at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions as a Software Engineer.

### My passion

- I am really fond of travelling and dream of becoming a globetrotter someday.
- I also like to click some pics while travelling though I am not particularly good at it.
